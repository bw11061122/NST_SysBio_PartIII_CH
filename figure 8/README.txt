In this folder, I included:
- script required to reproduce figure 8a (MHC I)
- script required to reproduce figure 8b (MHC II)
- script with functions called in the main script (myfunctions.py)
- coordinates of CH variants screened (ch_variants_coordinates_tp53_added_nts.csv)
- binding predictions for MHC I (20240210_NetMHC_HLA_UKBB_with_affinities_bestscores.csv)
- binding predictions for MHC II (6 files total; 3 for DP-DQ and 3 for DR)
- output: figure 8a (MHC I)
- output: figure 8b (MHC II)
- output: figures for density each variant split by MHC I / MHC II threshold (for each variant tested; including those presented in the main report)
